        <p>The fruit of the common custard apple (Annona reticulata), also called sugar apple or bullock’s-heart in the West Indies, is dark brown in colour and marked with depressions giving it a quilted appearance; its pulp is reddish yellow,
          sweetish, and very soft (hence the common name). Soursop, or guanabana (A. muricata), sweetsop (A. squamosa), and cherimoya (A. cherimola) are widely cultivated worldwide. Alligator apple, or corkwood (A. glabra), a native of South America
          and West Africa, is valued for its roots, which serve the same purposes as cork; the fruit is not usually eaten fresh but is sometimes used for making jellies.</p>

        <p><span class="step-header">Obtain sugar apple seeds</span>.You can get sugar apple seedsfrom your local garden center or, if you have a friend with a tree, you can get the seeds from the flesh of the apples. You could also order seeds from
          an online retailer.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If you obtain seeds from the flesh of a sugar apple, you’ll have to wait one week after removing the seeds from the flesh before planting them. They don’t germinate very well if you put them in the ground right away. Cut open your
              sugar apple fruit and pull out the big, black seeds. Put them in a seed envelope and wait one week prior to planting.</p>
          </li>
          <li>

        <p><span class="step-header">Soak your seeds to speed up germination</span>.Although germination can take thirty days, you can speed up the process by soaking your seeds. Wrap up your seeds in a piece of paper towel. Soak the seeds with a bit
          of water. Place the seeds with the paper towel in a ziplock bag. Let
          your seeds soak for three days and then plant them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Alternately, you can scarify the seeds. Lightly sand the seeds. Then, soak them in warm water for twenty-four hours. In this way, you can speed up the seed preparation process and improve germination time.</p>

        <p><span class="step-header">Find a sunny spot to start your seedlings</span>.Since sugar apple is a tropical tree, you’ll want a sunny spot to start your seedlings. You’ll want to put your seeding tray in front of a south facing window so
          that the seeds get plenty of warmth and light. If you don’t have a south
          facing window, you’ll need to install grow lights.</p>

        <p><span class="step-header">Put potting soil in a seeding tray</span>.You’ll need a seeding tray that is at least two or three inches deep and has drainage holes, which you can obtain at a garden center. Fill the seeding tray with fresh
          potting soil from the garden center, as opposed to soil from your
          garden. You’ll want to moisten the soil a bit before planting the seeds.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Sugar apple trees do well in most soil types as long as there is good drainage. They will not tolerate any water-logging, so avoid getting the potting soil sopping wet at this stage. It should be moist but not soaking.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img class="numbers" src="images/num5.png" alt="">
        <p> <span class="step-header">Put the seeds in the soil</span>.In your seeding tray, plant the seeds two or three centimeters deep. They should be spaced one and a half centimeters apart. The plants should germinate within thirty days.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Alternately, you could purchase a grafted sugar apple tree from a nursery.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Once the seedlings are mature, you can transplant them outside.</p>

        <img class="numbers" src="images/num6.png" alt="">
        <p><span class="step-header">Water your sugar apple seedlings</span>.Spray the seeding tray with a mister to keep the soil moist but not soaking. Since sugar apples do not tolerate water-logging, it is best to let the soil dry out a bit
          between waterings. You can stick your finger one inch into the soil to check the moisture level. If it feels dry at a depth of one inch, you can spray the seedlings.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>You can use a fan to ensure movement of air over the seedlings, which will help prevent disease.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Symptoms of water-logging or "flood stress" include yellow leaves, stunted growth, wilting and browning, as well as fallen leaves.</p>

        <p> <span class="step-header">Rotate the seeding tray to ensure adequate light</span>.Every few days, you should rotate the seeding tray so that all of the plants are able to enjoy the benefits of the south facing window. If you are growing
          under a light, you should set the timer for fifteen hours per day and remember to let the seedlings rest in the dark for the rest of the day.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If you are using grow lights, you’ll need to raise them as the seedlings grow.</p>

        <p><span class="step-header">Transplant outdoors in warm climates</span>.You should plant your sugar apple tree in a tropical or near-tropical climate. Since sugar apples can tolerate some level of drought, you could plant it in a dryer
          climate. Cooler temperatures are not tolerated, so avoid planting it outdoors in places with cold temperatures in the winter or at night.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>

        <p><span class="step-header">Transplant your sugar apple seedlings in the spring</span>.You can transplant your sugar apple tree in the spring or whenever the temperature reaches between 73 to 94 Fahrenheit (23-24 Celsius). You should find a
          place that has some wind protection, plenty of sun and is not prone to water-loggging.</p>

        <p> <span class="step-header">Choose an area that gets full sun</span>.Sugar apple is a tropical plant that grows well in South America, Asia and Africa, so it enjoys the sun! You should plant it in a sunny spot that is well protected from
          the wind.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The location should be sunny at least eighty percent of the time.</p>
          </li>

        <p><span class="step-header">Make sure the soil gets good drainage</span>.Choose rich, well draining soil for your sugar apple tree. You could plant it in sandy, limestone or a heavy loam soil, since it tolerates a range of soil types.
          However, you should avoid water logged soil and ensure adequate drainage.</p>

          the size of the root ball. Place the root ball in the planting hole, cover and water the seedling.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>

        <ul>
